## Description

JavaScript CRUD Operations Using LocalStorage is a simple web application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the browser's localStorage API. It allows users to insert, read, update, and delete data stored in the browser's localStorage.

## Usage

To use the application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How It Works

The application provides three main functionalities:

1. **Insert/Update Data**: Enter a key and a value to add or update records in localStorage.
2. **Read Data**: Enter a key to retrieve the corresponding value from localStorage.
3. **Delete Data**: Enter a key to delete the record associated with that key from localStorage.
4. **Delete All Data**: Click the "Delete All Data" button to clear all records stored in localStorage.

The application updates the displayed records in real-time as changes are made to the localStorage.
